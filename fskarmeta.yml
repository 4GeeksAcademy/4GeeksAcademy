    summary: |
      After a long period of flirting with the humanities and the arts, I've
      discovered a pasion that integrates very well with my personality:
      web developmente.

      Currently absorbing the entire spectrum, from design to arquitecture
      and implementation of systems. Willing to work in a company or project
      that gives me meaning and allows me to continue learning.
