    summary: |
      I have extensive studies in different areas. Firstly, I did a degree in Fine Arts at the University of Barcelona, since I have always been passionate about drawing. Later I completed a Master's Degree in Secondary Education, since education is another of my passions and in this way I could combine my passion for drawing with teaching. Later I took a degree in Early Childhood Education since I really like working with toddlers, and I think that teaching from early childhood is extremely important. I have 8 months of experience working in different schools and kindergartens for ESO and preschool students.
      
      Finally, my interest in web development aroused for some time now, so I decided to jump in and take on this new field head on. I am currently taking the Full-Stack Software Developer Bootcamp at 4GeeksAcademy.
