    summary: |
      Entrepreneur, self-taught, and proactive.
      I studied Business Administration at the Complutense University of Madrid.
      After finishing my studies, I founded an indoor golf school in Madrid with one of my best friends.
      I managed the school for three years, reaching a total of 400 students.
      At the end of the third year, I decided to sell my company to pursue my true passion: becoming a programmer.
      During this period, I also became interested in the logistics sector.
      Simultaneously, I worked at a courier service focused on large companies (transport broker) and later in the air cargo sector.
