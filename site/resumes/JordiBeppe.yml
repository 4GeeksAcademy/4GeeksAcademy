      I studied industrial design with a focus on design of both physical and
      digital products, developing skills in problem solving and with a vision
      of constant research and development, with an awareness of constant search
      for new technologies and having particular attention in problem solving,
      with training in resource and personnel management. I created elements for
      the development of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and visual
      impairment, and worked with communities of artisans to create production
      models applicable to their work.
