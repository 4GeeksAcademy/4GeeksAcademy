    summary: |
      I have experience as a 3D artist in different  
      complex software such as video game engines, 
      I have decided to change course due to the current 
      market situation.

      
      As my old jobs required, I have programming experience 
      and I know that it is something that I am passionate about, 
      so I entered this 4geeks academy bootcamp knowing what 
      I could find and what it would be like to develop 
      my programming skills.
