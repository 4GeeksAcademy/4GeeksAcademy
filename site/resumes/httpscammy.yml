    summary: |
      I am a high school teacher transitioning into a software developer. With a background in education, I posess strong communication abilities and pedagogical expertise, which aids in explaining complex technical concepts to colleagues and clients.
      The teaching experience has aided me in patience, problem-solving skills, and adaptibility. Embarking on this career change, I have taken the steps to acquire programming languages and technical knowledge through a boot camp called 4Geeks. This career change
      may seem abrupt but I have learned through teaching that I would rather be the one challenged and creating the innovative solutions than attempt to teach that in students.
