    summary: |
     I have spent most of my adult life in service to the United States of America, first as an active duty enlisted U.S. Marine for a little over 8 years. 
     In the Marine Corps my jobs was a Combat Videographer, thats a mean way of saying I shoot and edit video in mostly live situations, trained for combat, 
     but I never went to combat. My last duty station in the Marine Corps was at Camp Johnson, NC where I learned how to write the back end for our multimedia
     program there. I used Macromedia Director Lingo (an object oriented programming language) to write code to make the courseware interactive, meaning that 
     it would allow you to take a test after watching a bunch of videos and animations that I also helped to produce, provide learning checks, test you on your
     knowledge and then allow the instructor to see the test scores. 

     After I got out of the Marine Corps, I landed a job at Camp Pendleton where I continued creating courses and interactive sites until one day the powers that 
     be decided I would make a better print monkey than a coder and alas they put a chain on my leg and tied me to a printer where I made booklets and posters for 
     about 12 years until I decided that I could no longer handle the 8-10 hour workdays and 2 hour one way commute with kids and responsibilities and I was ready for 
     a change. I switched job after job, asking them if when I got there could I perform software development in my duties and they all said yes but I wasn't doing any of that. 

      So after playing around for too long I decided to take the fork in the road DOGE buyout and go to school and learn how to do it anyways and hopefully find another job 
      that allows me to become and do what it is I have wanted to do for so very long.
