      I strive to be the best version of myself, I want to learn programming, master Javascript, typescript, Microsoft programming language, and dwell into python.

      details: |
        Went to school for business administration, missing 2-3 classes for my full bachelors, but dint see a lot of passion in that field.
        I might return to obtain it, but for now it was put aside while I focused on Full-stack, UX and UI passion.

          - Still want to get my bachelors in some point down the line.
          - My side passions took me into another route, which I enjoyed a lot, as I put business administration aside.
