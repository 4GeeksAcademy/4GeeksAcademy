    summary: |
      I have worked as a cook and pastry chef for 12 years in hotels, restaurants, bakeries and as a freelancer, where I have learned to work in a team and under pressure (a lot of pressure), but although I like it, my hobby has always been the digital world (video games, animation, design, etc.) so I have decided to study programming and try to develop myself in the world that has always caught my attention.
