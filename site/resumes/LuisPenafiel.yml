        The biomedical sciences curriculum provides students with a strong foundation in molecular
        biology, microbiology, and cytogenetics, focusing on DNA and RNA structure, molecular
        diagnostics, and nucleotide base-pairing rules. Additionally, students study pathophysiology,
        learning about human pathological processes, homeostasis, and biological sample
        management. The curriculum also covers biochemical analysis and immunodiagnostic
        techniques for disease diagnosis, as well as hematological analysis for blood disorder
        monitoring and diagnosis.
