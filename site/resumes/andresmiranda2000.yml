# Personal Information
basic_info:


    first_name: Andrés
    last_name: Miranda
    motto: I like learning new things
    focus: Programming
    summary: I have 2 careers in progress, one of them is Graphic Design 
      and the other is this Full Stack Programming Bootcamp. The two 
      complement each other because programming also needs design and 
      that's why I chose both.
