    summary: |
      I'm a Technical Busines Analyst with specialization in LabVantage LIMS.
      Have experience in the pharmaceutical, forensic toxicolog, RnD, and Biotech industires.
      My education started on my home island Puerto Rico to which I was born and raise. 
      I acquired my B.S. degree in industrial chemistry and worked in laboratories making 
      easy to complex experiments following the different pharmacopeias USP, EP, and JP. 
      This exposure led me to Buffalo, New York where I acquired my M.S. degree in Chemical Engineering, 
      it was during my stay in Western New York that I identified that every lab I participated in had a LIMS application. 
      This sparked my interest and led me to begin my career with LIMS.

      With a background in chemistry, I bring a distinctive perspective to the world of coding.
      The analytical skills and problem-solving acumen honed through my study of chemical reactions 
      find resonance in the world of coding algorithms. Just as I once marveled at the elegant interactions between elements, 
      I am excited to bring a similar spirit of discovery to crafting innovative software solutions.
