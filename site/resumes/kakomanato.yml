    summary: |
      Coming from the scientific world as a college graduate oceanographer, I've decided to jump into the world of coding by participating on the part-time full-stack bootcamp program of 4Geeks Academy. I'm aiming to improve my skills to the point I can be employed to become part of a team of diverse people to develop interesting and ever-evolving software.
