    summary: |
      Currently I'm working as a Software Maintenance Engineer at Red Hat giving support and advice to customers based on EMEA mainly but including other regions. I'm mainly focused on managed services that include OpenShift on AWS(ROSA) and Azure(ARO) in which we are in charge of their infrastructure. Since my new role, I'm driving technicall conversation across different regions that has global impact in multiple teams and more important, in the customer success. 

      In parallel I'm starting my Cibersecurity career by learning on my own resources on the subject, any recommendation on the topic or opportunity will be highly appreciated.

      Helping other teammates to growth and contribute as much as possible to the community and to the team. Thanks to my previous jobs as a DevOps I'm currently learning and contributing on GitOps, Service Mesh, Tekton, Pipelines where I'm helping customers with their issues/implementations.

      As always, I'm still learning everyday since it's one of the things that make me happy in my professional live, if I don't put and achieve goals, the life start being boring and nobody wants that! 

      Previous knowledge in Python. 

      Passion for languages thanks to my family's multiculturalism, great knowledge of the Portuguese language and studying French (A2-B1) and English (B2-C1) so I love the new places where I can develop this part of me and the new national or international challenges, preferably in environments with great cultural and linguistic variety. I'm working on an international environment so I'm enjoying the option to improve my English skills and meet people from different cultures to learn from them. I am very dedicated in my non-working hours to continue increasing my technical and cultural knowledge.

      I would like to be able to connect with people from the same or different sector with whom we can help each other with knowledge exchange and possible projects.
