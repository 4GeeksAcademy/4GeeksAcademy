    summary: |
      Former ASE Certified Master Automotive Technician with over a decade of experience in Honda and Ford. While 
      I’m no longer under the hood, the problem-solving mindset from my automotive days still drives my work today.
      I now focus on SQL, data analysis, and full-stack software development. Adding to my Bachelor of Science in 
      Information Technology from Florida State University, I’m currently expanding my technical skill set through 
      the Fullstack Software Developer bootcamp at 4Geeks Academy. Avid Lego aficionado.
