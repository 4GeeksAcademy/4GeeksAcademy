  summary: 
    I'm a Chilean photographer turned tech enthusiast, now based in
    Valencia, Spain, with a bit of Buenos Aires in my history. After years of
    developing film in darkrooms, I've shifted my focus to developing code,
    studying to become a programmer. A lover of technology, design, and music,
    I’m now merging my hands-on creative skills with the digital world. From
    winding film to writing algorithms, I’m diving into tech with the same
    passion I had in the darkroom, aiming to create and build the future—one
    carefully crafted line of code at a time.

    details: I began my artistic exploration as a visual artist, immersing myself in
      various forms of creative expression. My studies focused on mastering the
      use of visual elements like color, composition, and form, which helped me
      develop a keen eye for detail and aesthetics. Through painting, drawing,
      and mixed media, I learned how to convey powerful messages and emotions
      without uttering a word. This foundation in visual storytelling paved the
      way for my later work, helping me see the world through a lens of
      creativity, always searching for meaning in every frame, line, and shadow.

      As I ventured into the world of photography, I honed my skills across
      both analog and digital mediums. My formal education in photography
      allowed me to delve deep into film photography, where I became passionate
      about the process of capturing images on film and developing them by hand
      in the darkroom. From understanding the nuances of different film stocks
      to perfecting exposure and composition, I embraced the art of analog
      photography. Alongside that, I gained experience in digital photography,
      mastering post-production techniques and working with illumination to
      craft the perfect shot. This blend of classic and modern techniques shaped
      my unique photographic style, balancing tradition with innovation.
