    summary: |
      For years my professional work touched lead positions in high self-paced and high performing innovative environments of work because of my scientific and technological mindset and skills. 
      I grew professionally as a project manager in multiple cross industries like science, art, technology, IoT, AV, CX. With 10 years of experience and extensive training I became a fast learner with a high skill set to handle multiple projects from different sources of knowledge. 
      At this part of my life I'm looking forward to a new challenge that could be my way of life. 
      Always positive and an outside the box thinker, with an analytical and artistic path of seeing things and life.
