        The study of History as an academic discipline has provided me with the opportunity to critically examine past events and processes. Through this degree, I have acquired skills to analyze primary sources, contextualize events, and understand the complexities inherent in historical interpretation. While the experience has allowed me to explore diverse periods and cultures, I have also faced the challenge of dealing with the subjective interpretation of history and the lack of access to complete information. Ultimately, the degree in History has equipped me with valuable tools to approach the past with a more informed and critical perspective.
