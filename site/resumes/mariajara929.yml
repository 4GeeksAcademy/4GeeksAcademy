    summary: | 
      My name is Mar, just Mar, a seeker of stories and weaver of worlds. By trade, Im a graphic designer, though Ive recently ventured into the labyrinth of code, where every symbol is a spell and every line a path to discovery. My journey has taken me through the realms of fashion and digital media, a tapestry woven over 12 years of creativity and innovation. I hold two masters, one in editorial design and the other in branding, yet my true passion lies in the stories I tell, the whimsical characters I create, and the magical worlds they inhabit.
