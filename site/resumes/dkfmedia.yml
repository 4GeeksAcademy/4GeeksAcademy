    summary: |
       I've spent several years in customer service and worked as a quality analyst for two years. 
       In the last year, I've shifted gears into the digital world, creating content on social media about tech and working as a content creator and photographer for small businesses.
       Along the way, I started building websites and doing some basic coding, and I've fallen in love with it.
       Now, I'm excited to bring my mix of customer-focused experience and newfound coding skills to the table as I continue to grow as a content creator and developer.
