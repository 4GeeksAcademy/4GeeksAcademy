  motto: To Make the Best better..

  focus: Presence

  summary: 
          My journey into programming began with a lifelong passion for video games. 
          I was always fascinated by how games were built—the logic behind the gameplay, the design of the systems, and the code that brought it all to life. 
          That curiosity gradually led me to explore programming, and once I began writing code myself, I discovered a deep passion for problem-solving and digital creation.
          
          What started as a hobby quickly evolved into a clear career path. I realized that programming combined both the technical challenge and creative freedom I had been searching for. 
          Motivated by this realization, I made the difficult but purposeful decision to leave college and dedicate myself fully to becoming a software developer. 
          It was a bold step, but one that allowed me to focus entirely on mastering the skills I needed to build the kind of technology—and games—I had always admired.
          
          I enjoy programming because it allows me to think critically, build creatively, and continuously improve. 
          Whether developing software, designing systems, or solving complex problems, I find great satisfaction in turning ideas into functional, efficient solutions. 
          Programming has become more than a profession—it's the career that aligns with both my interests and long-term goals.
