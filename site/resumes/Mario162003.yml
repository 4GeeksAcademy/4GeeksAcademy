      details: |
        Studying business administration was not a simple choice for me, because I was not aware if that degree
        would fit me. However, I have really enjoyed those three years of the degree, since I have learned a lot, 
        and I have found what suits best for me. I really liked the part from finance and data analysis, and in fact my next goal
        is to study a master degree which combines both of them.
