    summary: |
      I'm a mechanical engineer who discovered hi was not in the correct way. I realized that I hated cars and structures and I liked
      science, people and software. I reconduced myself working as science teacher, and summer camp instructor, kids and teenagers are really funny. However my real goal was learning software 
      so I can travel and work, so I'm here, in 4Geeks to acomplish this objective.
