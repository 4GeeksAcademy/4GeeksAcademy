    summary: |
      My name is Eliza and I'm an experienced Internal Audit/Internal Controls consultant currently working with clients in the Fintech industry. I have a strong background in internal audit and internal controls testing, which have provided me a unique skillset and expertise that I leverage in analysis and process improvement initiatives.

      I'm strongly self-motivated, quick learner, and group-oriented, which makes me a valuable asset to any team. To further expand my knowledge and enhance my data analysis capabilities, I have enrolled in beginner SQL courses (in SQLite).

      I'm passionate about utilizing my analytical skills and attention to detail to help drive decision-making, formulate impactful and meaningful improvements, and contribute to the overall success of business owners and stakeholders. Outside of work, I enjoy playing board games and exploring the great outdoors through hiking.
