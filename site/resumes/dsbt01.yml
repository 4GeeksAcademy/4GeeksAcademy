        I was first interested in study medicine but it was too much for me to do at the time.  So after 
        my cousin sugested that I take a look at the MIS program at FIU, I changed my major and I simply 
        loved it. This is not work for me.  This is fun.

       in multiple technologies and have been in the company for a while, I can easily navigate the complexities
