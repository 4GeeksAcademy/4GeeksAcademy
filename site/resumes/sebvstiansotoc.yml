  summary: >
    I am an active outdoorsy person who also enjoys being indoors and
    spending time on the computer. 

    I was a professional bike rider for many years and after that, I have been an insurance adjuster for several years. 

    For quite a while now, I have had an interest in web development. So I decided to jump in and take on web development head on.
