    summary: |
      I went from being an administrative assitant to becoming a full time stay at home mom.
      While being at home I knew I wanted a job that could be done remotely without interfering
      with my family time especially time with my kids. I came across a coding course and I took it 
      as a sign. I quickly registered and here I am, beginning to fulfill my dream.
