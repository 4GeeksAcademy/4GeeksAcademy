    summary: |
      I began my professional journey as a lifeguard, working 
      for over a year in both pool and beach settings. This
      role honed my ability to stay calm under pressure,
      make quick decisions, and work effectively as part of
      a team. Ensuring public safety required strong situational
      awareness, problem-solving, and communication skills—qualities
      that have shaped my approach to professional challenges.
      
      Following this, I worked in a bicycle shop for eleven
      months, gaining hands-on mechanical experience and customer
      service expertise. I also pursued a Mechanical Engineering
      degree at Florida Universitaria, completing three years
      before shifting my focus to software development. Currently,
      I am deepening my technical skills through a Full Stack
      Development bootcamp at 4Geeks Academy, where I am
      learning front-end and back-end technologies. My diverse
      background reflects adaptability, a strong work ethic,
      and a passion for continuous learning—qualities I am
      eager to bring into the tech industry.
