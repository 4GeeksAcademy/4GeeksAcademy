  summary: >
    I am currently in the second year of my Computer Engineering degree and
    taking a bootcamp to enter the job market and start my career doing what I
    love. Additionally, I have a degree in languages, which I hope will someday
    help me bridge the gap between cultures. I am passionate about continuous
    learning and constantly strive to be better than I was yesterday.
