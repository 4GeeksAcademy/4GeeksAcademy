    summary: 
      I am an accomplished QA Lead and software engineer with 14+ years of experience spanning from nuclear submarines, to multifamily IoT, to AI applied to HR SaaS. I am best recognized for an ability to leverage my technical expertise in object-oriented programming, DevOps, test automation, and coaching/leading agile teams as a scrum master. My recent employment as a Software QA Test Engineer and prior volunteer work have demonstrated my leadership capabilities, both able to perform as an individual contributor and ready to step into team management responsibilities where needed. Strongly prefer continuously-improving & collaborative work cultures, roles that nurture a growth mindset with ample opportunities to both learn and teach, and automation.
