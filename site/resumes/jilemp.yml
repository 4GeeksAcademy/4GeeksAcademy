    summary: |
      The last ten years I've been dedicated to the wine and spirits industry, first in production working for wineries in Chile, Australia and Germny. More recently, I shifted within the wine indsutry towards sales and marketing in export markets in South East Asia. I've learned how to engage with different
      people through these experiencies and adapt to different work environments, while also building my language skills and self confidence.
  
      Data tools have brought great value to my performance in every job role I've had. My professional journey continues in the direction of extracting as much value as possible from the increasing amount of data that institutions and individuals generate nowadays..
