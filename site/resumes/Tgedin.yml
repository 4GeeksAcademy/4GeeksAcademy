    summary: |
      I'm transitioning from real estate project management to data science and machine learning, 
      seeking to combine both fields to create innovative solutions for urban development challenges. 
      I enjoy working with interdisciplinary teams and applying data-driven approaches to optimize 
      planning and resource allocation. Currently based in Valencia, I'm developing my technical 
      skills while leveraging my background in real estate and urban planning.
