        The Bachelor's Degree in Computer and Systems Engineering is a proposal of specializations with a strong emphasis on 
        the development of original computer elements and tailored to a specific solution. It is based 
        on a solid mathematical and computational foundation that allows the formation of more critical professionals oriented to the development of innovative solutions.
        
        Based on the general theory of systems and the paradigm of computation, it integrates the aspects inherent to the study of systems and 
        the mastery of the fundamental elements of computation, to offer a balanced curriculum in line with the market reality. It satisfies the 
        need for a professional with the ability to adapt and generate computer solutions to problems where what exists in the market does not meet 
        their expectations.
        
        The formation of the graduate is constituted by three areas of knowledge that integrate the study plan, through the distribution of courses: Humanistic, Scientific and Professional.
