    summary: |
     A product designer from Alicante with a strong passion for illustration, design—and of course—surfing, motorcycles, and enjoying sunny terraces.
     Originally focused on visual design, a UX/UI bootcamp at Ironhack opened the door to a path that blends creativity, logic, and empathy. Since then, I’ve been dedicated to crafting digital experiences that solve real problems and create value for both users and businesses.
     I’ve worked at large companies on a wide range of projects—B2B, B2C, SaaS, mobile apps, and responsive websites. Each experience has helped me grow and adapt to different environments and challenges. More recently, I’ve worked as a freelancer, gaining more autonomy and perspective on design processes and cross-functional collaboration.
     Currently, I'm also learning to code to build a more complete and versatile profile within the tech industry.
     I like to think of myself as a “design mechanic”: someone who’s not afraid to get hands-on, break down problems piece by piece, and build thoughtful, functional solutions—right down to the last pixel.
