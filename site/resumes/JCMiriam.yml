    summary: 
      My interest on programming appeared when I was around 19, when I was learning about Robotic while I was studying a degree on Arts.
      Since this moment I decided to continue learning about Software Development and currently I am a Frontend Developer with around 3 years of experience.
      Furthemore, I have always been interested on Machine Learning and Data Science, so I think that this is a good moment to start the 4Geeks Bootcamp and acquired new skills.
