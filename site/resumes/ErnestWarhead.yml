    summary: |
      I am dedicated and meticulous, with a profound respect for professionalism, teamwork, and the pursuit of excellence. Although my formal programming knowledge is in its nascent stages, my proficiency with technology runs deep. From a young age, I was the go-to resource for computer-related inquiries within my social circle. In Cuba, I leveraged loopholes to enhance internet accessibility and become one of the pioneers in adopting email and mobile data services in times when these were vastly restricted. I also excelled in various entrepreneurial ventures. This innate technological savvy, combined with my diverse skill set in customer service, workflow optimization, and innovation, forms the foundation upon which I seek to build my programming expertise.
