    summary: |
      My career is to be assist in making websites be functional to the company of those websites and helpful to the user interacting with those websites.
      It's something that goes hand in hand with wanting to build a website that is quick and easy for the user to navigate easily with no hassle.
      I find it similar to how I enjoy helping those around me and my family since I'd want to give back to those who helped me along the way of my journey to coding.
