    motto: Applying artificial intelligence to everything

    focus: "Automate processes that make you earn more money"

    summary: |
      I really enjoy programming, analyzing data, finding details and applying
      artificial intelligence in everyday life. I have been programming with python
      for a year now and without hesitation, I would choose it every time. I have
      written a case study applying data science about customer satisfaction in
      e-commerce and I am also developing artificial intelligence agents with python.

      details: |
        In my career I have learned the basics of marketing, one of the things I valued
        the most was that they taught me big data, with it to analyze the data, shape
        them and find those details that do not stand out. Apart from that, it taught me
        to manage social networks, create audiovisual content and manage advertising
        campaigns.
