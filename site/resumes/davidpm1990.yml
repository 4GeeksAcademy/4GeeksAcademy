    summary: |
      My name is David, and I am someone who has decided to make a career change in my life. I have been self-employed in the carpentry sector for my entire life, running a company called PARMAR where we specialize in custom-designed bathroom furniture.
      After many years of working hard and running the business, I decided to make a career shift and venture into the world of tech. I started by taking online courses in my spare time, and as I enjoyed working in this field, I decided to take it a step further and enroll in a bootcamp at IRONHACK Madrid.
      Having acquired all the knowledge and skills, and proficiently handling various tools, I am now ready to embark on a career in the tech industry as a Web Developer. The skills I have learned include React, Javascript (ES6), MongoDB, Express, Node.js, HTML, and CSS.
      Throughout the course, I worked on three different projects. In module 1, I developed a 2D animation video game using Canvas in Javascript. In module 2, I built a complete CRUD web app in the back-end. Finally, in the third and last module, I developed a full-stack web app using React.js.
      I have also worked with various APIs in the last two projects of module 1 and 2. Currently, I am employed as a full-stack developer at FlagX, where we are developing unique software for construction companies and real estate developers.
      If you would like to know more about me, please feel free to contact me!
      Happy coding! Happy work!
