    summary: |
      I studied a vocational training in telecommunications and computing. 
      After a year I started a degree in Electronic Engineering. 
      I have worked in many places but none of them related with my studies. 

      In 2020, I started another vocational training in something 
      I have always loved, fitness. Again I worked in things but
      unluckily nothing related with all my studies.

      Nowadays I'm working in a burger's shop and I'm studying
      to be a full stack developer because I'd like to build
      a good future as a developer and I like it.
