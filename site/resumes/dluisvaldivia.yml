      I studied in Australian Pacific College, in a campus in Sydney's
      vibrant city centre. The course, at the time, consisted of learning to be
      responsible for identifying and analyzing the needs of a company or
      organization, and then designing and implementing IT solutions to meet
      those needs. It involves working closely with stakeholders to understand
      business requirements and translate them into functional specifications
      for IT projects.
