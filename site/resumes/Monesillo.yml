    summary: |
      After a long time searching something to be good on i finally found this cool
      bootcamp, i was working before in other types of areas but i feel like nothing of
      that was for me so, if i love computers and i love learning this was my best option.

      Im trying to be a professional dev and I feel like it will be hard but if you try so hard
      something you are looking for you could easy get it.
