  summary: >
    My professional path has covered many areas of the IT world. I started
    implementing point-to-point link configurations in mining companies like
    Escondida,

    where later, looking for a new challenge, I went to the capital of Chile to work as a Network Engineer for the Anglo American project. After that my professional 

    direction took a turn and I left the configurations and consoles to dedicate myself more to the administration part as a client of several providers.


    You might think I've done it all, but no. Now I return to the fields implementing professional services, and also as a Microsoft Azure instructor for courses like

    az900 and az104.
