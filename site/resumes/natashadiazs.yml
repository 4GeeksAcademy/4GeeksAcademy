    summary: |
      I'm an Electronic Engineer with mention in Mechatronics and 3D designer of robotic mechanisms, 
      but mainly a fan of learning new things and challenge myself, the more difficult something is to understand, 
      the more I want to learn it and that's why I became passionate about creating game development and web development.
