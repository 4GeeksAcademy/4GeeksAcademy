    summary: |
      Most of my working career I have worked for myself. I have always had an
      entrepreneurial "spirit". Though I have worked in warehouses and stores
      such as Dollar General or Walgreens; I have always found myself wanting to own
      or build a company. While self employed I mainly sold products through 
      ecommerce but also taught myself architectural illustration by which I have
      done many 3D rendering and animation projects.
