      details: |
        In my recent experience, I focused on automating all school processes and occupational health and safety procedures using advanced IT tools. 
        I implemented a comprehensive solution to reduce paper usage and facilitate quick access to information by digitizing all necessary data. 
        To achieve this, I designed and developed eight types of applications using AppSheet, enabling more efficient and centralized data management. 
        These applications not only improved the speed and accuracy of information access but also ensured a more sustainable and organized environment within the companies.
