  summary: |
    Everyday I love a little bit more coding. I discover this passion with Harvard's "CS50's Introduction to Computer Science", 
    that led me to self-educate in subjects such as web development and object oriented programming. I am a responsible and passionate person, 
    who always try to do better and learn something every day. But above all, I am a team player, used to work with all kind of people with different cultures everyday.
    I think those qualities will help me to grow in the developer world and even more a person. Since I started with the web development studies,
    I've been using HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQLite, Python and Ruby, starting to use React and Flask and looking forward to learn more frameworks.
