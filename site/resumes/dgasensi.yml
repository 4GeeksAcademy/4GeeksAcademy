      time: 2005 - 2008
      company: SECURITAS, L'Oceanografic(Valencia)
      details: |
        My time in the CCTV control center served as an excellent preparation for
        transitioning to a team leadership role. In that position, you become 
        accustomed to maintaining focus for extended periods and act as the liaison
        between the team leader and department heads within the service, as well as 
        with SECURITAS managers and emergency services when necessary. In addition,
        it is essential to become technically acquainted with a wide range of 
        specialized software, including camera management systems, video recorders,
        and intrusion alert systems, understanding not only how they operate but 
        also how to identify any malfunctions.

    - role: Hardware technician, Video editing and photo retouching
      time: 2000 - 2003
      company: freelance
      details: |
        In my early days as a hardware technician and designer, from 2000 to 2003,
        I saw a lot of changes in the world of PCs. Back then, we were
        still fiddling with jumpers on motherboards, and if your computer
        hit 100 MHz, you were doing pretty well. Every small retouch in a picture takes
        5 minutes for being processed. But in those few years, 
        things started to shift quickly. It was a time of rapid learning, adapting to the
        new tech that just kept on coming
