      We learn the basics of programming, using strongly typed languages. Where I managed to carry out projects that helped me little by little understand about programming.

        - In the initial modules I developed a program that simulated an ATM using Java, I learned the basics of programming, developed logic and we used some OOP.
        - Another of the projects that I managed to carry out is a login system where I learned to use Javascript, putting logic and regular expressions into practice.
        - For the completion of the Degree, create a system that would manage insurance companies, clients, and home repairs. The technologies in the backend were PHP, OOP, Javascript and some AJAX, following the Model View Controller architecture.
