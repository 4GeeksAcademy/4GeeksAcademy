    summary: |
      I am a dedicated Full Stack Junior Developer with a passion for creating efficient and user-friendly web applications. 
      My skill set spans both front-end and back-end development, allowing me to build comprehensive solutions from start to finish.


      Combining front-end and back-end skills, I develop full-stack applications that are both functional and scalable. 
      I utilize REST APIs to ensure smooth communication between the client and server, and I am adept at building single-page applications (SPAs) and implementing server-side rendering (SSR) for improved performance
