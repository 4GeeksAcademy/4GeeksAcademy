    summary: |
     First I started doing more labor intensive work. From there I decided I wanted to further my education and strengthen my skills set. 
     I then moved to Los Angeles to pursue film making. I grew a love for production but realized I wanted to further my skill set even 
     more. Thats when I discovered Data Science. Now my goal is to understand the world of Data science.
