    summary: |
      After more than 10 years in the hotel business in different cities and countries I decided to make a change and leave my comfort zone.
      Thanks to my partner I started to feel attracted to programming and decided to take this step.
      I discovered that it is a world in which you never stop learning and training, and even though I have never studied anything about it, I am now doing a bootcamp with my partner,
      now I am doing a bootcamp with the motivation and confidence to be able to achieve whatever I set my mind to.
