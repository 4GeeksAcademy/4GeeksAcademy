  summary: >
    I'm a biologist with more than 20 years of education and professional
    work experience. I've worked for state and federal governments,
    universities, and a non-profit. My master's degree is in entomology, which
    delights me to no end because here I am, still focused on finding bugs -
    even after a wild turn in my career trajectory! My background is that of a
    research scientist, which is all about creative problem solving. As a
    scientist, I have learned how to keep in mind the big picture of what I hope
    to accomplish with my work, while focusing in on individual components of a
    given problem, to try and systematically solve the puzzle of a given
    biological phenomenon. Much like writing code! I've learned to thoroughly
    and consistently document my work, so that it is replicable by others. I've
    also learned to collaborate with other researchers to carry out cohesive
    projects remotely.

      I earned a master of science degree from the University of Florida in the 
      Entomology and Nematology Department, graduating with honors (magna cum 
      laude). For my research project, I was responsible for the development and
      implementation of a citizen science project called Backyard Bark Beetles. 
      The project is sadly no longer active, but you can read about it here --> 
      (https://www.citizenscience.gov/catalog/397). My project was aimed at 
      large-scale monitoring of invasive bark and ambrosia beetle species 
      utilizing help from citizen scientists. I not only developed an effective 
      trap and testing protocol using readily available household products, I 
      also discovered a novel and inexpensive method for temporary field 
      preservation of insects using hand sanitizer. I assisted with the creation 
      of a project website (no longer active), which was my first time doing any 
      kind of web design. I generated and disseminated outreach materials, 
      presented research at professional scientific meetings, and conducted 
      extensive public outreach. I also taught at the undergraduate level and 
      learned a ton about interdisciplinary and cross-institutional collaboration.

      I am currently undergoing a period of metamorphosis! I am learning an entirely new 
      skill set to add to my existing (and extensive) experience and skills as a scientist, 
      maker, caretaker, and mother.

      In May of 2022, I made the decision to amicably leave my full time job as a Biological 
      Scientist with the Florida Department of Agriculture to focus on my family after the 
      worst parts of the pandemic. My intention was to take one to two months off to reconnect 
      with my child, who had a very difficult time during the pandemic, but that one to two 
      months turned into one and then two years of focusing on my family after my daughter 
      became ill and required full-time care. I have been incredibly privileged to have a 
      loving, supportive wife who has supported me financially through this time. My daughter 
      is finally doing better and I am more than ready to get back into the work force! I have 
      not been idle during my time away from work. I've spent time learning HTML and CSS via 
      FreeCodeCamp and Ruby via Launch School, which has sparked my interest in web development
      and programming, which led me to 4Geeks and the bootcamp that I am doing now to jump 
      start my career transition so that I can get back to solving puzzles and making money!

      I loved my job at FDACS-DPI! I was in a supervisory roll, responsible for all aspects
      of establishing an insect mass rearing program for state-wide biological control of the 
      invasive weed Schinus terebinthifolia (Brazilian peppertree) in Florida. I managed all 
      laboratory, greenhouse, and field research operations. I established and maintained 
      plant and insect colonies. I hired, trained, and supervised staff. I built and maintained
      collaborations with state and federal organizations. I sought external grant funding. I 
      secured and maintained research permits. I established and maintained field research 
      sites. I managed an $80k budget including personnel, equipment, travel, supply 
      inventories, and purchasing. I collected, analyzed, and summarized research data. I 
      performed administrative duties and I conducted outreach. I did a lot! I was actually 
      really great at this job and I had the best boss. I'm confident that he has nothing 
      but great things to say about me. If you're wondering why I don't go back - there are a 
      number of personal and political reasons why I prefer to avoid working for the state of 
      Florida at this time.
