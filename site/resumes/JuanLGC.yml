    summary: |
      Computer sciences lover, This passion has led me to self-educate in subjects related to web development,
      IT, object oriented programming, etc. I considere myself a responsible, persistent person, who makes everything on its hand
      to be the best teammate possible, but specially, I am always hungry for knowledge; All these qualities will help me to grow
      as a developer and as a person.
