    summary: |
      Both my academic preparation and my professional career have revolved around the tourism sector, being able to develop my knowledge in the most important business hotel company in Spain.
      Taking into account professional trends, I decided to embark on the adventure of the universal language of the future, programming, and thus be able to combine the knowledge of both and adapt to the professional needs of the market.
