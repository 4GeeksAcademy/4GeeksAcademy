        The Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering and Computing (B.EIC) is a program jointly offered by the Faculty of Engineering (FEUP) 
        and the Faculty of Sciences (FCUP), as part of an initiative aimed at enhancing the provision of higher education in Computer Engineering at the University of Porto. 
        This initiative seeks to address the evolving and impactful needs of society in this rapidly advancing field. 
        The program is conducted at the facilities of FEUP.

        The overarching goal of the B.EIC program is to foster excellence in the scientific and technical foundations of Computer Engineering and Computing (EIC). 
        It equips graduates with the ability to pursue further studies at the master's level, 
        enabling them to assume leadership and innovation roles in complex contexts or to enter the job market with the skills necessary 
        for the development and operation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-based systems. 
        To achieve this, the program offers comprehensive training that encompasses

          - A rigorous foundation in fundamental engineering sciences, particularly Mathematics and Physics.
          - A broad-based education in the major scientific and technical areas of EIC, including programming, algorithms, computer architecture, operating systems, 
          computer networks, software engineering, databases, cybersecurity, computer graphics, interaction, and artificial intelligence. 
          This education aligns with international best practices and recommendations, notably those of the ACM and IEEE.
          - Flexible training in cross-cutting competencies.

        In summary, the B.EIC program aims to provide a robust educational foundation in Computer Engineering and Computing, 
        preparing graduates for advanced studies and leadership roles, 
        as well as for employment in positions related to the development and operation of Information and Communication Technology systems.
