    summary: |
      Started as a receptionist at an immigration law firm before becoming a paralegal, then later, Director of Operations. But my undergrad and masters' degrees were in Sustainability, so I used my sales experience next at a waste brokerage company. While working there, I started at 4Geeks to become a developer, so I can work remotely and travel the world, and make money doing it all.
