  focus: learning everything I can from FullStack course in 4GeeksAcademy
  summary: >
    I've been working as a Laboratory Technician in research field for the
    last 6 years, and I realise there is no use for me anymore to continue (at
    least for now) working in this, as conditions are not really good, and
    possibilities to grow not that many.
    So I took the decision of learning about programming with the FullStack bootcamp with 4GeeksAcademy, and hopefully I'll find a new job in no time.
