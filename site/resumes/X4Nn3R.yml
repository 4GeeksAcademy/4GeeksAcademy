        The career as a physicist and geophysicist focuses on the application of physical and mathematical principles to understand and analyze the structure and dynamics of the Earth. Geophysics is a discipline that combines physical measurements and physical-mathematical models to explore and understand the Earth system, including its interior, the ocean, and the atmosphere.

          - Explore and understand the structure and dynamics of the Earth: Using measurements of Earth system properties, geophysicists create and use quantitative physical-mathematical models to analyze and understand the structure and dynamics of our planet.
          - Develop skills in measurements and modeling: Geophysics students learn to design, plan, and execute geophysical studies, including the acquisition, processing, and interpretation of data.
          - Practical applications: Geophysics is applied in various areas, such as the exploration of natural resources, environmental protection, the assessment of natural risks, and the optimization of infrastructure.
