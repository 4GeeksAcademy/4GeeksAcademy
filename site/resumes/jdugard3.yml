    summary: |
      I am an experienced loan officer looking to pivot into the tech industry. I have always had a passion for computers and tech but always saw it as too costly to go into since I did not graduate college with a degree in computer science. But here I am now, focusing on completing this full stack developer bootcamp! 

      Some fun facts about me is that I am a husband and father, I love to play music (specially the guitar), and I love playing video games!
