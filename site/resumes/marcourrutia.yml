  focus: developing personally and professionally
  summary: >
    I studied computer science technician when I finished high school in
    2009. Then I continued with engineering in 2019. Since 2010 I have worked in
    various fields. Currently, I am an information manager at a hospital where I
    manage patient databases. I am also attending a 4Geeks Academy BootCamp to
    improve my programming skills and find a job related to that field to
    develop myself more as a professional.
