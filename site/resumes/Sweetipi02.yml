  summary: >
    My current responsiblities require me to aid in the physical portion of
    applicants joining the Military. Those duties consist 

    of performing hearing, vision, blood collection and drug screen urinalysis. I stay abreast on the most up to date regulations and guidance

    passed down. I have served 4 years with the Military, which I believe allows me a particulaer level of compassion and understanding

    with assisting the current brave individuals, who pursue the opportunity to join the Armed Forces and devote time to serve their country.
