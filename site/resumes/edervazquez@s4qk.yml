    motto: Math solver & everything's lover.
    
    focus: Reaching high new levels on all kind of skills and self-improvement to help me & others.
    
    summary:
      I love challenges which involves solving problems, I don't like to give up easily, always searching for new ways
      to see life and what offers me and I can offer to. Since I was a child I discover that when pressure comes to me
      , the resilence comes out of me to achieve whatever I want to achieve.

      I am an atypical man that wants to understand how the world works through solving problems which implies learning 
      new things.
