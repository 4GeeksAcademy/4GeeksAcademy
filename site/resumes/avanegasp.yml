    summary: |
      Specializing in Customer Service, I understand the importance of providing quick and 
      concise responses to address user concerns. With a background in fast-paced environments, 
      particularly in startups, I bring technical expertise in programming languages such as 
      Javascript and React, along with proficiency in databases. I've expanded my skills into Data 
      Science, SQL, Python, and Excel.

      Having executed projects catering to hundreds of users, I've successfully managed and 
      coordinated project implementations across various departments. My organizational skills and 
      thorough documentation aim to create scalable processes that reduce dependency on individual 
      contributors. I thrive on automating processes and am dedicated to supporting both my team 
      and users.
