    summary: |
      With a solid background in technology and engineering, 
      I specialize in the design and deployment of LED Color
       Test Stations and advanced Photospectrometry using 
       Konica Minolta equipment. 
       My hands-on experience with 
       high-precision photometric and 
       colorimetric systems allows me to 
       ensure quality control in complex 
       manufacturing environments. I have a 
       passion for precision testing and leveraging 
       data-driven insights, enhancing efficiency, 
       and optimizing product quality across projects.
        My GitHub showcases contributions to related fields 
        and collaborative projects where my expertise in 
        instrumentation and data analysis has driven 
        innovative solutions.

        Photometer improvement measurement in the production line:

          We have created state of the Art Quality Control Checkpoints, using
          advanced Photometer Technologie. The device is developed by KONICA-MINOLTA
          SEE:  https://sensing.konicaminolta.us/mx/products/cm-17d-espectrofotometro/
          The device communicates in real time to a production workstation PC or laptop,
          or even cellphone.

          The Chart display after testing gives a Cylindrical Spectum Model that
          ensures the part is being produced correctly, with correct R-G B and R parameters,
          with correct clarity.

      - title: WCM Management
        link: "#hook"
        tagline: "World Class Manufacturing (WCM) Methodology

World Class Manufacturing (WCM) is a comprehensive management approach 
focused on continuous improvement and waste reduction across all aspects
 of manufacturing. Developed by Professor Hajime Yamashina in the 1980s, 
 WCM combines principles from lean manufacturing, Six Sigma, and Total 
 Quality Management (TQM) to create a holistic approach for optimizing 
 production processes. This methodology emphasizes structured problem-solving 
 and data-driven decision-making across ten technical pillars, including safety, 
 quality control, cost optimization, logistics, and people development.

By following WCM practices, companies strive to achieve operational excellence
 through systematic elimination of inefficiencies, improvement in quality, 
 reduction of downtime, and a commitment to environmental responsibility. 
 WCM has been widely adopted by major manufacturing companies, including 
  Chrysler Automobiles (now Stellantis) and Unilever, to increase productivity, 
  reduce costs, and create a sustainable competitive advantage."
