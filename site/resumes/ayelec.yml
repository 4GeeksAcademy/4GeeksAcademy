  summary: >
    With over 10 years of experience as a criminal lawyer, I am currently
    undergoing a professional reinvention, integrating emerging technologies
    such as artificial intelligence, data analytics, and fullstack development.
    This transition is not merely about acquiring new tools—it's a commitment to
    rethinking the professional role and designing innovative solutions that
    blend logic, efficiency, and purpose.
