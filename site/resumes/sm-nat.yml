    intro: >
      I have been immersed in the world of programming since 2022, a time when I had no prior knowledge of the realm of computing and didn't even own a computer. However, my fascination with the internet has always been present. I delved into this entirely unknown world, and it captivated me completely. This interest drove me to seek ways to transform this fascination into more than just information.
      I embarked on a journey to learn Python and enrolled in courses on logical thinking through **Platzy** Over the course of a year, I built a foundation that allowed me to enter a bootcamp, providing me with a more comprehensive knowledge base and paving the way for a professional career in the field.
      My projects, born from the **4Geeks bootcamp**, have been instrumental in my learning journey. They serve as tangible evidence of my growth and the wealth of knowledge I've acquired. Every project is a stepping stone, propelling me closer to my goal of establishing a successful career in the realm of programming. Each line of code written represents a commitment to continuous learning and a testament to the transformative power of dedication and passion. As I move forward, I am not just building applications; I am sculpting a future where technology meets innovation, and my journey is a testament to the belief that with determination and curiosity, one can navigate uncharted territories and emerge victorious.
