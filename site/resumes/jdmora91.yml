    summary: |
      I am a passionate and hardworking full stack developer in training, with a strong foundation in cybersecurity, currently completing the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.

      My journey has not been easy — I made the life-changing decision to move to the United States, leaving everything behind in my home country to pursue a better future. I’ve worked hard every day to improve not only my technical skills but also my English, my mindset, and my ability to adapt and thrive.

      I’m driven by a deep love for technology, problem-solving, and creativity. My dream is to become an excellent developer and one day work at Epic Games, contributing to projects that inspire millions.

      I bring with me determination, resilience, and a growth mindset. Whether I’m learning new technologies or pushing through challenges, I stay focused on my goal: to build secure, high-impact solutions and become a valuable part of any development team.
