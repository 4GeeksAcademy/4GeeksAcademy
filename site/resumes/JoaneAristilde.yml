      details: |
        At McGraw-Hill, in my role as Senior Technical Program Manager & Scrum Master since 2022, 
        I've collaborated with multiple cross-functional teams, both onshore and offshore, to build applications and platforms,
        including working closely with Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) teams. 
        I've leveraged tools like Jira, Confluence, and Rally to efficiently manage and track project progress.
        My understanding of the software development life cycle, combined with strong problem-solving and analytical skills,
        has been instrumental in my work. I've taken the lead on AI-based initiatives, 
        focusing on developing and enhancing autonomous learning platforms. In this dual role,
        I've managed 3 to 5 concurrent projects, steering cross-functional Agile teams through various stages,
        from story grooming and sprint planning to demos and retrospectives. 
        My efforts have been key in integrating work from different subsystems into cohesive, high-quality software solutions,
        making a significant impact on the global learning experience.
