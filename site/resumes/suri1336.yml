    summary: Graduating high school early, I obtained a cosmetology license and worked as a nail tech, providing flexibility for exploring diverse career options. Intrigued by the growing popularity of web development, I took a free beginners' course and fell in love with it. Facing the challenge of self-teaching, I enrolled in a bootcamp to guide my journey towards becoming a Full Stack Developer, combining my unique background and newfound passion for a fulfilling career.
