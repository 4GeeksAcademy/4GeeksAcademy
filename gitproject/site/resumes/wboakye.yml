    summary: |
      I am an aspiring web and software developer with an established background in customer service. I started out working in
      small boutiques building soft skills like communication. I then went into high-end retail where I honed my abiliuty to anticipate
      the needs of a more demanding clientele. From there I joined the United States Air Force which gave me a sense of discipline 
      and sparked my passion for problem solving.
