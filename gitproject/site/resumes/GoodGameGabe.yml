    # You have 1 paragraph to make a great impression, summarize your career.
    summary: I came up as a film student taking my time figuring out how I want
            my products to come to life.  I apply a similar philosophy to coding
            where I don't give up until I crush the malleable coal...from there, 
            I pick up the specks of diamond and keep piling them up towards my glistening kingdom.
