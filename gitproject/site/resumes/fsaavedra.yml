        As a Backend Python Developer at Gregario, I was responsible for developing code and
        performing scrapings using Python. I utilized the Celery library to fetch the required information
        from various web pages and then sent it to a PostgreSQL database. Additionally, I worked with
        Docker containers and leveraged the Django API for implementing the business logic.
        Throughout this role, I gained experience in efficient data extraction and storage in a database,
        as well as creating scalable and robust solutions within an agile development environment.
