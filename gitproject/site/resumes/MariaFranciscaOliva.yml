    summary: |
      "Since graduating from college, I have focused my career on writing, editing, and creating
      content for small businesses and entrepreneurs. I produce the written material that appears
      on the websites of law firms, financial firms, and other small and medium businesses in
      Florida and throughout the Southeast. Having worked with websites for a decade in a non-
      technical position, I have grown to appreciate the role played by developers, as well as the
      growth of the field. In 2018, I decided to shift my career focus to coding and software
      development."
