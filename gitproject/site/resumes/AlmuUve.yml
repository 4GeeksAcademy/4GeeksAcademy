    summary: |
      Enthusiastic about communication with more than 6 years of experience in marketing agencies and departments.
      |
      After developing myself as a professional in communication projects, marketing, digital marketing, e-commerce, social networks, Amazon ... I decided to develop myself in the field of new technologies, learning how to program thanks to 4GeeksAcademy.

      On a personal level, what fullfills me is learn languages, visit a museum, take a plane anywhere, enjoy a good movie or attend a concert.
