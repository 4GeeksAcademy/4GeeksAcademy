     I’m excited to share that I’m embarking on a journey into data science, driven by a passion for uncovering insights from data. Although I’m just starting and don’t have previous experience in the field, I bring a strong foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving from my background. I’m eager to learn and apply concepts such as data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling to real-world challenges. This new path is not just a career shift for me, but a thrilling opportunity to explore the potential of data in making informed decisions and driving innovation.
