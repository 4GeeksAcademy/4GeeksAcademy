         is a process of design applied to products that are to be manufactured through techniques of mass production.
         
         Its key characteristic is that design is separated from manufacture:
         
         the creative act of determining and defining a product's form and features
         
         takes place in advance of the physical act of making a product, which consists purely of repeated, often automated, replication.
         
         This distinguishes industrial design from craft-based design,
         
         where the form of the product is determined by the product's creator at the time of its creation
