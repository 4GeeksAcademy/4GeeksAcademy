        In this company, I have worked both as a consultant on different HR issues (training, climate, 
        organizational studies using statistics, between others), and also developing HR online platforms in the 
        role of designing the wireframes, thinking the functionalities of the platform, and testing it (QA) before it goes to the final client.
