    summary: |
    I am a lover of Computer Science. This passion has led me to self-educate in subjects such as web development, IT and object oriented programming, amongst others. I consider myself a responsible and driven person, who always strives to be the best teammate possible. But above all, I am always hungry for knowledge. All these qualities will help me to grow as a developer and as a person. Due to my passion for programming, I have trained myself in HTML5 and Javascript. I am currently training as a Full-Stack Developer and will gain advanced knowledge in: HTML5, CSS, Javascript, React, Python, SQL, Git, along with other technologies. Whilst I finish these studies, I am looking for a job that allows me to continue my development and grow in the programming sector.
