    summary: |
      Initially after being in sales, and customer service for over 15 yrs
      I decided to make a change. This change I seeked was not ordinary, nor
      was it something just anyone could do. It was a change meant to put me with
      a very elite class of people, capable of shaping the world we live in. Simply
      put learning to code was one of the best decisions of my life.
